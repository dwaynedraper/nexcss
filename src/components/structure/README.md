The [structure](../structure/) folder is for the layout components that define the structure of the page. Essentially, these are the components that will be used in the root layout.tsx file of Next.js. This will include components like the main layout, header, navbar, footer, main content pane, chat bar and sidebar. Layout elements for the main content of the page will go in the [layout](../layout/) folder (fifty-fifty, photo grids, etc.).
